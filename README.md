# java-todolist
I asked google bard to show me a todolist app in Java that use Maven within Gradle. And here it goes

# Basic:
I use Macbook. Java is already installed.
I have homebrew installed

## Why
I am new to Java. Like 8 years ago I once wrote some things in Java, 
to play around with its code and also to try building an Android application.
My new job - the company uses Java. So I decided to learn again.
Okay let's start simple.

## What I might have missed
I don't know Java very deep yet, the purpose is to see how things work in high level

## Steps
1. Install gradle: `brew install gradle`
2. Install maven: `brew install maven`
3. Install IntelliJ IDEA CE: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=mac
4. Create a new todolist project using IntelliJ IDEA, that use Gradle
5. Search: `show me a simple java todolist app with gradle` in google bard
